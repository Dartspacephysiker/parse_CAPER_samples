I am so sick of trying to figure out over and over again how to plot binary data. I hope I can remember that this is the place where I have these examples located.

From http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14472419/plotting-1d-binary-array-uint8-with-multiple-records-in-gnuplot


plot "bin.dat" binary array=(50):(50) format='%uint8' using 1 with lines


#This example allows you to plot just 100 samples of binary data for two separate records within the same file.

plot "bin.dat" binary array=(100) format='%uint8' skip=4 using 1   with lines, \
"" binary array=(100) format='%uint8' skip=104 using 1 with lines
