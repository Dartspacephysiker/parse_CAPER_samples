N_MEASUREMENTS		7		//Number of measurements in this link
SFID_IDX		1		//Location of subframe ID within minor frame, counting from 1
BPS			9600000		//Transfer rate of this link, in bits per second


#Minor/major frame description
SAMPLE_BITLENGTH	16		//Length of each sample in bits (remember, 8 bits per byte)
