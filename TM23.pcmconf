#NOTE the following:
#  -->A line beginning with '#' is treated as a comment
#
#  -->A line beginning with ';' marks the end of an array. 
#     If ';' is the ONLY value below an array keyword (e.g., MEAS_LSB_WORD), it is special shorthand to indicate
#        that all corresponding array values should be zero.

#	SFID_IDX				 //Location of subframe ID within minor frame, counting from 1
#	BPS					 //Transfer rate of this link, in bits per second

#	SAMPLE_BITLENGTH                         //Length of each sample in bits (remember, 8 bits per byte)

#	N_MAJFRAMECOUNTERS			 //Number of major frame counters in this link
#	N_MINFRAME_BITPOS			 //Number of bits required for minor frame counter (e.g., up to 4 minor frames requires
#					         //  two bit positions to count 0, 1, 2, 3). This is used to form a unique counter from

#******SPECIAL VALUES******
#
#MEAS_TSTAMP_SEARCH_WORD: 0x00 corresponds to NO_TS_SEARCH, or no search word
#
#*For combining MSB/LSB channels*
#COMBINE_MSB_AND_LSB      : For PCM streams with MSB and LSB words of measurements, combine MSB and LSB on the fly
#
#UPPER6_MSB_LOWER10_LSB   : Oddly, some measurements split into MSB/LSB words are packed differently.
#                           This value indicates the word location for which the upper 6 bits of the MSB word
#                            and the lower 10 bits of the LSB word are to be kept.
#
#MEAS_LSB_WORD            : '499' corresponds to TM_SKIP_LSB, so that if channels are being combined, this channel is not outputted
#			      e.g., For ELF-AHI_MSB and ELF-AHI_LSB, the ELF-AHI_LSB entry for MEAS_LSB_WORD is '499' to indicate that
#                             we don't want to output ELF-AHI_LSB as its own channel.
#                         : '498' corresponds to TM_NO_LSB, to indicate that this channel has no associated LSB word.
#
#
#******Note on timestamp calculation (MEAS_TSTAMP_CALC_TYPE)******
#
#CalcType = 1: TStamps calculated relative to GPS word, samples output to binary
#CalcType = 2: TStamps calculated relative to GPS word, samples and TStamps output to ASCII
#CalcType = 3: TStamps calculated rel. to TSSW, using measurement's word period; samples and TStamps output to ASCII
#CalcType = 4: TStamps for searchword are outputted along with the TSSW sample number where the searchword was found
#CalcType = 5: TStamps calculated rel. to TSSW, using measurement's word period; samples to binary and TStamps to ASCII
